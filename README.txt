#Intro

Simply a collection of twitter bots (and maybe for other stuff) made with python for learning purposes.
Some files used by the code might be missing (as well as the access keys), but the content of those should be obvious.


# Endless Bot

This bot (@dos_lenda) grabs each line from the localization files of the game Endless Legend and tweets them.
It takes one hours between each tweet, unless the sentence had to be split due to size constraint. In that case, it waits only 1 minute before posting the next section.
